Sectra- Programming Assignment - Simple Calculator


Running instructions(Windows):

Step 1: Open the terminal.

Step 2: Locate the Debug folder path in SimpleCalculator:
e.g cd \emil\SimpleCalculator\Debug

Step 3: Run program by typing: SimpleCalculator.exe

Or run with file: SimpleCalculator.exe [path] 

Where [path] is the location to the .txt file.

Assumptions:
Register names cannot be composed solely of digits (Would cause ambiguity)
Registers can only contain and support operations with integers, not doubles etc.
Not assigning a value to a register will evaluate to 0 at print.
